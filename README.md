# Dotfiles

## Installation

To install, clone this repo somewhere like `~/dotfiles`. After that, make the following symlinks (back them up by hand first if needed):

```sh
ln -s "${HOME}/dotfiles/.bash-customizations"
ln -s "${HOME}/dotfiles/.oh-my-zsh-customizations"
ln -s "${HOME}/dotfiles/.bash_logout"
ln -s "${HOME}/dotfiles/.bash_profile"
ln -s "${HOME}/dotfiles/.bashrc"
ln -s "${HOME}/dotfiles/.gitconfig"
ln -s "${HOME}/dotfiles/.hgrc"
ln -s "${HOME}/dotfiles/.zshrc"
```

Not sure about the `.cinnamon` thing, it's here for historical reasons until it gets deleted.
